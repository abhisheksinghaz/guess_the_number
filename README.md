# guess_the_number
Enter the range of integers, then try guessing the number.
Increase or decrease your guessed number based on the feedback received from the program.

Project idea picked-up from geeksforgeeks.org

How does it works?
step 1. Run the script.
step 2. It will ask for "Range begins at: ", enter any integer here.
step 3. It'll ask for "Range ends at: ", enter an integer greater than the integer entered at step 2.
step 4. the program will terminate once the guessed no. matches the random number picked by the program.

Tip: Guess a no. which divides the total available range for guessing the numbers into two.

Decorators need to be added.
